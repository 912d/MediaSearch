# MediaSearch

MediaSearch will be, in the end, application for Android (IOS in the future, though).
It will allow you search, set up “alerts” (for specific query and/or hashtag) and browse most popular media services.twitterlogo

I am planning to use Twitter, Instagram, Wypok (Polish copy of digg.com) and Facebook. Also I have plans for Youtube, but YT module capabilities will, of course, differ a little bit.
